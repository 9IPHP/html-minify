# HTML Minify
Minify your HTML output in WordPress.


## How It Works
Getting started with HTML Minify is as simple as installing a plugin:

1. Upload the `html-minify` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the Plugins menu in WordPress.
3. Pat yourself on the back.

Seriously, you're done. Nice work! You change what gets minified under "Settings" in the Admin Dashboard.
